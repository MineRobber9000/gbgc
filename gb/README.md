# GameBoyGamesCom GB ROM

The goal of this project is to create a network for GameBoy games to be able to access game-specific content hosted on the internet.

This ROM will do... something. The initial idea was to have it download a menu that could be used to select other games, but that may not be what this ROM ends up being. Its main purpose is to serve as an example for how the GameBoyGamesCom can be used.
